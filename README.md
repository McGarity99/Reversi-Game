# Reversi-Game
JavaFX-8 implementation of Othello-based Reversi.

This project was originally composed for academic purposes in a Software Development course 
at the University of Georgia in Fall 2019. However, significant alterations have since been made.
These include removal of several bugs, drastic alteration of the UI, and the introduction of an optional
random-select AI with which a single user may play as opposed to the original design of player-vs-player.

This project is not meant to be redistributed and is intended only as a demonstration of my skills with Java programming as
well as desktop application development via JavaFX.
