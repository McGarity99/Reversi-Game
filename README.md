# Reversi-Game
JavaFX-8 implementation of Othello-based Reversi.

This project was originally composed for academic purposes. However, significant alterations have since been made.
These include removal of several bugs, drastic alteration of the UI, and the introduction of an optional
random-select AI with which a single user may play as opposed to the original design of player-vs-player.

Additional features I would like to add eventually include:
- [] AI improvements for increased difficulty
- [] Option to change game's color scheme mid-match
- [] Option to save the game and return to it later
- [] Remote multiplayer via sockets
